[root]/dds
  David's Documentation System
  a bash-like environment for publication production and management.
  "backed up monthly"

  [root]/dds/bin
    DDS commands and pipelines (used by DDS XMLSH workflows)
    contains commands used by sysadmin and users. May also contain commands 
    which are used indirectly by scripts.

  [root]/dds/etc
    DDS configuration files (used by DDS XMLSH workflows)
    contains configuration files: local file used to control the operation of 
    programs; static, non-executable. 

  [root]/dds/lib    
    DDS libraries (used by DDS XMLSH workflows)
    contains those shared library images needed to boot the system and run the
    commands in the root filesystem (/bin, /sbin) "backed up weekly"
        /xslt
        /xproc
        /xquery
        /xmlsh?

  [root]/dds/sbin   
    Sys Admin Utilities
    Root-only commands are stored in /sbin, /usr/sbin, and /usr/local/sbin. 
    /sbin contains binaries essential for booting, restoring, recovering, and/or repairing the
    system in addition to the binaries in /bin.
    tangle should be in here)
    Programs executed after /usr is known to be mounted (when there are no problems) are
    generally placed into /usr/sbin.
    Locally-installed system administration programs should be placed into /usr/local/sbin.

[root]/home   
  Publications Library

      /sbin   extra Java libraries, etc, ie. XEP for separate clients
      /src    Literate documentation of client's code

[root]/var    
  persistent DDS logs and caches
  contains variable data files. This includes spool directories and files, 
  administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files. 
  Everything that once went into /usr that is written to during system
